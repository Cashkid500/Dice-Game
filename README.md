This Dice-Game is a game of two players. The player 1 rolls dice to generate random dice roll, the dice rolled is being displayed to check if it is a 1 or any other number from 2 to 6. if it is a 1, the game will automatically switch from player 1 to player 2, but if it is otherwise, the rolled dice is added to the current score to display player 1 new score.
Player 1 can continue to roll dice as long as 1 is not been rolled, he also has the option to hold score which adds the current score to his total score to check if the total score is greater than or equal to 100.
If the total score is greater than or equal to 100, player 1 wins the game and player 1 can reset the game to set all scores to 0 making player 1 as the starting player, but if otherwise, player 2 continues to play.
